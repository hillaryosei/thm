## What is the OSI Model?
* OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model provides a framework dictating how networked devices sent, receive, and interpret data
* One of the benefits of the OSI model is that devices can have different functions and designs on a network while communicating with other devices
* There are 7 layers in the OSI model (from top to bottom): Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical
* At each layer that data travels through, specific processes take place, and pieces of information are added to that data (this is called encapsulation)

## Application Layer
