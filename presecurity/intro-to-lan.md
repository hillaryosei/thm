* Introduction to LAN Topologies
  * LAN (Local Area Network) 
  * Star Topology
    * Pros: commonly used because of its reliability and scalability
    * Cons: more expensive because it requires more cabling and purchase of dedicated network equipment, requires more maintenance to keep it functional, still prone to failure
  * Bus Topology
    * Relies on a single connection (backbone cable)
    * Pros: one of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up
    * Cons: little redundancy in place in case of failures because of its backbone cable, prone to become slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data, difficult to troubleshoot
  * Ring/Token Topology
    * Devices are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware
    * Sends data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward the data
    * Pros: less prone to bottlenecks
    * Cons: isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network because it goes in one direction, a fault (ex: cut cable, broken device) results in the entire networking breaking
  * Switches
    * Dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet
    * Keep track of what device is connected to which port
    * Can connect a large number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 for devices to plug into
  * Routers
    * Connect networks and pass data between them
    * Routing: process of data travelling across networks, involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered
